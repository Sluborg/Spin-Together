# Project status — Spin-Together

_Last updated: 2026-07-03 (Phase 2)_

## Current state
**Phase 2 (Core loop, solo) — DONE and deployed live. ✅**
Playable single-device run on the dev URL: spin → individual own draft → communal shared draft
(both skippable, own hard-capped at shared+5) → rent deadlines → board growth (4×4→6×6) →
win/lose. Pure engine, 31 unit tests green, verified end-to-end via headless playthrough
(reached D4 / 5×5, synergies compute correctly, zero console errors).

**UI polish (post-Phase 2):**
- **Board = slot machine** with a **reel spin**: reels scroll symbols **downward** one row at a
  time, land staggered left→right with a bounce, then **hold ~0.9s so the result reads** before
  the draft opens. Only the **current board** is shown (starts **3×3**, grows to 6×6); no 6×6
  preview. Per-slot payout is a small **rounded-rect gold tag** (radius 4, not a coin).
- **Combined draft:** one overlay shows **both pools at once** — **Your pool** (gold) and
  **Shared pool** (teal), visually distinct. Tap a card in each to select (glow feedback; tap
  again / leave blank to skip), then **Confirm** applies both. Engine reducer `resolveDrafts`
  replaced the sequential chooseOwn/chooseShared (phase `draft`; both offers drawn up-front).
- **HUD redesign (new-player clarity):** a gold **GOLD** box (styled like the payout tags) + one
  **RENT** box = amount due, `Deadline n/8`, a progress bar, `N spins left`, and a live
  `need X more` / `✓ covered` status. Dropped the board-size stat.
- **Post-spin flow:** the reels land, then a **Continue →** button (with "Spin paid +N gold")
  lets the player read the result before opening the draft (replaced the fixed delay).
- **Rarity coloring:** draft cards tint border + label by rarity (common grey · uncommon green ·
  rare blue · very-rare purple · special orange). Spin button de-iconed ("Spin"). Removed the
  event-log footer (the single "Spin paid" line covers it).
- **Deferred:** normalizing per-sprite outline weights (no clean fix-by-rule; would be per-sprite).
- **Sprites: frame-free 16px pixel** (Tiny-style). Kenney Tiny Farm for farmer/hen/carrot;
  coin + gem are **original CC0 pixel art** (Kenney's Tiny *item* tiles carry an inventory-slot
  frame — the "thick brown border" — so they're avoided). Crisp via `image-rendering: pixelated`.
- **Draft** is a centered overlay with a hide/show toggle.
- Names: Copper Coin, Gemstone, Prospector, Barn Hen, Carrot — **ids + mechanics unchanged**,
  reversible. Sourcing in `docs/assets/pack-map.md`; provenance in `CREDITS.md`.
  _Owner is iterating on feel._

Prior: **Phase 1 (Scaffold)** — toolchain, CI, dual-branch Pages, both URLs live.
- Toolchain: Vite + TypeScript (strict) + ESLint (flat) + Vitest. `package.json` scripts:
  `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `validate-data`, `test`.
- Board renders on a phone: responsive 4×4 CSS-Grid board + placeholder HUD (coffer / rent /
  deadline / board size), mobile-first, no horizontal scroll at 360px (verified via headless
  screenshot). Bundle ~5.3 kB JS / 1.6 kB CSS.
- Data-driven load: `src/main.ts` loads `data/*.json` through typed interfaces
  (`src/engine/types.ts`); dev build runs the validator at runtime.
- **Loud-failing data validator** (`src/engine/validate.ts` + `scripts/validate-data.ts`,
  `npm run validate-data`): rejects dangling refs, bad enums, `chance ∉ [0,1]`, dup ids.
  Negative fixture + unit test in `test/`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): typecheck → lint → validate-data → test → build.
- Dual-branch Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`): composes `main`→root + `dev`→`/dev/` into
  one artifact. **Needs repo Pages Source = "GitHub Actions" to deploy.**

## Local verification (all green)
`typecheck` ✓ · `lint` ✓ · `validate-data` ✓ (5 symbols, 3 items) · `test` ✓ (2) ·
`build` ✓ (default + `/Spin-Together/dev/` base) · headless board render ✓.

## Deploy status
- Pages Source = GitHub Actions ✅ (composing workflow deployed both builds).
- `main`→root and `dev`→`/dev/` both verified live (HTTP 200 + JS 200), commit `f105417`.
- Remaining optional owner setting: **Settings → General → Default branch → `dev`** (if not
  already set) so PRs default to `dev`.

## Open questions awaiting owner
- **⭐ R-D1 (guardrail / draft destinations)** — still open; needed before Phase 2 codes drafting.
  Recommendation: let each player choose own-vs-shared destination per draft. See GAME_DESIGN §13.
- Confirm run length (8) and payout resolution order (canonical order already spec'd).
- Phase 4 networking requirements captured: TURN relay, wss, snapshot+localStorage resume.

## Engine (Phase 2, pure & tested — `src/engine/`)
- `rng.ts` mulberry32 (golden vectors) · `payout.ts` canonical resolver (integer math, snapshot
  semantics, destroy/transform/spawn/add/multiply + degenerate cases) · `draft.ts` guardrail +
  weighted offers · `economy.ts` rent/growth/rounds · `game.ts` reducers · `state.ts` types.
- 31 tests: RNG determinism, payout order + edge cases, guardrail property (`own ≤ shared+5`
  after every transition), win/lose. UI (`src/ui/app.ts`) is a thin DOM view over the reducers.

## Next action
**Await owner approval for Phase 3 (Dev tools):** symbol browser + tag filter, synergy graph,
in-browser live value editing + JSON export, `balance-report` wired to real data. (Two-player
P2P is Phase 4; balance tuning is Phase 5.)
